Components

The hardware and software components used for the implementation of the project are described below.

  1-	Tiva LaunchPad: Used to link the software and hardware parts, specifically to take the output values of the circuit to read them with the code
  
  2-	USB cable: To connect Tiva to the computer
  
  3-	Breadboard: Needed as support for electronic component assembly
  
  4-	Jumper wires: To attach principal components to each other
  
  5-	Resistor: Applies resistance to the current (56KΩ)
  
  6-	Flex Sensor: Main component of the project which changes the output values according to the bent.
  
  7-	Energia Software: open-source electronics prototyping platform aimed at bringing wiring and Arduino framework.
  
  8-	Processing Software: Free integrated development environment built for electronics arts and visual design. It is based on the Java language but with a lot of simplifications which makes it more useful to do simple tasks.
